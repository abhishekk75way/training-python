# 3. Conditionals and Loops in Python

This section explains Python control-flow constructs, including conditional statements and looping mechanisms. These determine the order in which statements execute based on runtime conditions.

## 3.1 Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow branching logic based on Boolean expressions.

### Syntax forms

* `if`
* `if / else`
* `if / elif / else`
* nested conditionals
* conditional expressions (ternary)

### 3.1.1 Basic `if`

```python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

### 3.1.2 `if / else`

```python
age = 16

if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible to vote")
else:
    print("Not eligible")
```

### 3.1.3 `if / elif / else`

```python
score = 72

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade A")
elif score >= 75:
    print("Grade B")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade C")
else:
    print("Fail")
```

### 3.1.4 Nested conditionals

```python
user = {"role": "admin", "active": True}

if user["active"]:
    if user["role"] == "admin":
        print("Admin access granted")
    else:
        print("Standard user access")
else:
    print("Inactive account")
```

### 3.1.5 Ternary Conditional Expression

```python
age = 20
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(status)
```

## 3.2 Looping Constructs

Python supports:

* `while` loop
* `for` loop
* loop control keywords: `break`, `continue`, `pass`
* `else` on loops
* iteration over sequences and iterables

### 3.2.1 `while` loop

Runs while condition remains true.

```python
count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

Common use cases:

* reading input streams
* polling
* indefinite loops with break condition

### 3.2.2 `for` loop

Iterates directly over an iterable.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]

for n in numbers:
    print(n)
```

Examples of iterables:

* list
* tuple
* set
* dict
* string
* range
* generator

### 3.2.3 Loop with `range()`

```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

### 3.2.4 Iterating dictionaries

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}

for key, value in person.items():
    print(key, value)
```

## 3.3 Loop Control Statements

### 3.3.1 `break`

Stops the loop immediately.

```python
for n in range(10):
    if n == 5:
        break
    print(n)
```

### 3.3.2 `continue`

Skips current iteration.

```python
for n in range(5):
    if n == 2:
        continue
    print(n)
```

### 3.3.3 `pass`

Placeholder for future code.

```python
for n in range(3):
    pass  # to be implemented later
```

## 3.4 `else` with Loops

`else` executes **only if loop did not break**.

```python
for n in range(5):
    print(n)
else:
    print("Loop completed without break")
```

With `break`:

```python
for n in range(5):
    if n == 3:
        break
else:
    print("This will not run")
```

## 3.5 Conditions, Loops, and Mutability Together

### Example: modifying mutable list in loop

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3]
for i in range(len(nums)):
    nums[i] *= 2

print(nums)  # [2, 4, 6]
```

### Example: immutable integers in loop

```python
total = 0
for n in [1, 2, 3]:
    total += n   # new int each iteration
print(total)
```

## 3.6 Practical Best Practices

* prefer `for` over `while` unless condition-based looping is needed
* avoid modifying collections while iterating over them
* prefer descriptive conditional expressions
* avoid deeply nested conditions; extract functions instead

## 3.7 Summary

| Feature          | Purpose                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| if / elif / else | conditional branching              |
| for              | iteration over sequences/iterables |
| while            | repeated execution under condition |
| break            | exit loop early                    |
| continue         | skip current iteration             |
| else             | runs if no break occurred          |
| pass             | syntactic placeholder              |
