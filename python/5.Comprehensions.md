# 1. Comprehensions

Comprehensions provide a concise way to create sequences (list, set, dict, generators) using a single expression instead of loops.

## 1.1 List Comprehension

Creates a list from an iterable.

```python
# Generate squares of 1–5
squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)
```

Output:

```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

With condition:

```python
# Keep only even numbers
evens = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(evens)
```

Output:

```
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

## 1.2 Dictionary Comprehension

Creates a dictionary.

```python
# Map number to its square
square_map = {x: x ** 2 for x in range(1, 6)}
print(square_map)
```

Output:

```
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

With condition:

```python
even_square_map = {x: x ** 2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}
print(even_square_map)
```

## 1.3 Set Comprehension

Automatically removes duplicates.

```python
nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
unique = {x for x in nums}
print(unique)
```

Output:

```
{1, 2, 3}
```

## 1.4 Generator Comprehension

Produces values lazily (not stored in memory).

```python
gen = (x ** 2 for x in range(5))  # round brackets = generator
print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))
```

Output:

```
0
1
```

Generators are efficient for large data.
